Sometimes lower layers might produce results that don't change the long-term, persistent UI state, but instead they should be propagated to the Fragment just once.

For example, an error might have happened, and we want to produce a one-time toast message about it. We don't want this Toast to reappear every time we put the app in the background and then the foreground again, or every time we rotate the screen - as it would happen if we simply stored this as part of its view state and handled it in the `render` method.

Navigation is another very frequent use case for these sort of events - we might do a bit of asynchronous processing based on user input (e.g. perform a save after a button click), and only when it's done do we want to proceed to navigate somewhere else. Again, we don't want this navigation to be triggered every time we arrive to this Fragment, so it can't just be a part of its view state.

These events are represented as the `OneShotEvent` type, and can be launched from a ViewModel using the `RainbowCakeViewModel`'s `postEvent` method. If they have no parameter, they can be represented as a simple `object`. Otherwise, simple classes with the parameters declared in their constructor as properties are recommended (there's no real need for a data class' complexity and overhead here).

```kotlin
class DataViewModel @Inject constructor(
        private val dataPresenter: DataPresenter
) : JobViewModel<DataViewState>(DataViewState()) {

    object NavigateSuccessEvent : OneShotEvent
    class NavigateFailureEvent(val errorMessage: String) : OneShotEvent

    fun saveData(data: Data) = execute {
        val result = dataPresenter.saveData(data)
        when (result) {
            is Success -> postEvent(NavigateSuccessEvent)
            is Failure -> postEvent(NavigateFailureEvent(result.message))
        }
    }
}
```

Handling these events is done by overriding the `RainbowCakeFragment`'s `onEvent` method, very similarly to `render`. This isn't required to be overridden by default, as not all screens will receive events of this kind.

```kotlin
class DataFragment : RainbowCakeFragment<DataViewState, DataViewModel>() {
    // ...
    
    override fun onEvent(event: OneShotEvent) {
        when(event) {
            is NavigateSuccessEvent -> navigator?.add(SuccessFragment())
            is ShowFailureEvent -> showMessage(event.errorMessage)
        }
    }    
}
```
