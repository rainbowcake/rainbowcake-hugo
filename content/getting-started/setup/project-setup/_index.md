The [Blank](https://github.com/rainbowcake/sample-blank) demo project (or its [Koin variant](https://github.com/rainbowcake/sample-blank-koin)) is a great way to start a fresh project built on *RainbowCake*. If you don't wish to use this starter project, here's what you need to set up.

### Screen one

You'll need a `ui` package that will contain your various screens. Having this specific name is required by the [screen template](https://github.com/rainbowcake/rainbowcake-templates#screen-template) which is the recommended way of creating new screens. After installing the template, create your first screen by invoking `New -> Other -> RainbowCake Screen` on the `ui` package, and following the steps.

Alternatively, see the [`ui/blank` package](https://github.com/rainbowcake/sample-blank/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/blank/ui/blank) of the Blank project for the pieces of an empty screen setup.

### Dependency injection

You'll need the following three pieces of code in place for your basic DI setup. These are usually placed in the `di` package.

- A module that binds at least one ViewModel. By convention, as long as there's just one module containing ViewModels, it's named `ViewModelModule`:

    ```kotlin
    @Module
    abstract class ViewModelModule {
    
        @Binds
        @IntoMap
        @ViewModelKey(UserViewModel::class)
        abstract fun bindUserViewModel(userViewModel: UserViewModel): ViewModel
    
    }
    ```

- A component that contains this module as well as the `RainbowCakeModule` that comes from the library artifact. This component also needs to extend `RainbowCakeComponent`:

    ```kotlin
    @Singleton
    @Component(
        modules = [
            RainbowCakeModule::class,
            ViewModelModule::class
        ]
    )
    interface AppComponent : RainbowCakeComponent
    ```

- Finally, an Application class that extends `RainbowCakeApplication`. This will override the `injector` property with the type of the concrete Dagger component that will be used in the application, in this example, `AppComponent`. The `setupInjector` method also needs to be overridden appropriately - it should create and assign an instance of the component:

    ```kotlin
    class MyApplication : RainbowCakeApplication() {
    
        override lateinit var injector: AppComponent
    
        override fun setupInjector() {
            injector = DaggerAppComponent.create()
        }
    
    }
    ```
    
    Make sure you set this application up in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file as well, in your `application` tag's `name` property.
 

### Navigation

If you use `rainbowcake-navigation`, make your `Activity` inherit from `SimpleNavActivity`, and load your initial `Fragment` like so:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : SimpleNavActivity() {

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
            navigator.add(UserFragment())
        }
    }

}
```
