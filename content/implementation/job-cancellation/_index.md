Internally, the `execute` method calls the `launch` coroutine builder to fire off a coroutine Job. The scope for these coroutines will be the ViewModel itself, as `JobViewModel` implements the `CoroutineScope` interface.

```kotlin
abstract class JobViewModel<VS : Any>(initialState: VS) 
    : RainbowCakeViewModel<VS>(initialState), CoroutineScope {

    private val rootJob: Job = SupervisorJob()

    final override val coroutineContext = Dispatchers.UI + rootJob
    
    // ...
}
```

The context of the scope is made up of two components: the UI dispatcher and a [`SupervisorJob`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-supervisor-job.html) instance that acts as the parent of all coroutines launched in the ViewModel.

- `Dispatchers.UI` describes the `CoroutineDispatcher` element to use, in this case, the Android UI thread until the job is placed on another dispatcher (for example, with a `withContext` call).
- `rootJob` provides the parent `Job` element for the coroutine. This is a simple, empty `Job`, only used to group the jobs launched inside a given ViewModel. The `rootJob` is cancelled  when the ViewModel's `onCleared` method is called - this is when the lifecycle it was attached to has terminated, meaning the `Activity`/`Fragment` is actually closed for good, and not just going through configuration changes.

```kotlin
override fun onCleared() {
    super.onCleared()
    rootJob.cancel()
    log("ViewModel cleared, rootJob cancelled")
}
```

Cancelling the `rootJob` will also cancel all of its child coroutines, which in this case is every coroutine launched with the `execute` method. Note that coroutine cancellation is cooperative. Blocking code running inside the coroutine will not be cancelled. Cancellation can only happen in suspending functions, and only if it's handled explicitly. An example of this can be found in the "Retrofit and coroutine adapters" section below.
