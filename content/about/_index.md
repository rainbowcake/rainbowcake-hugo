**_RainbowCake_ is production ready!** It has been in production for nearly two years now, in several applications, in the hands of (at least) tens of thousands of users.

<!-- margin-left:0 !important; -->

The development of RainbowCake started within [AutSoft](https://autsoft.hu/en), where the framework is being used to build greenfield Android/Kotlin projects (such as [Sender!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.posta.kepeslap)), and it also serves as the foundation for applications that are being refactored from Java to Kotlin (such as a certain HR application)[.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.nexon.nexonmobile) Both of these examples are running on RainbowCake in production.

There are also multiple non-public projects using RainbowCake, for example, the 150-screen, 100kloc app discussed [in this talk](https://zsmb.co/talks/#reviewing-kotlin).

### Where's the source code? How can I contribute? Where do I open issues?

You can take a look at the code and participate in the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/rainbowcake).
