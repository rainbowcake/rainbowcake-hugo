# About & FAQ

### Is RainbowCake production ready?

**_RainbowCake_ is production ready!** The version number not being 1.0 at this point means the following:

- Some of the API is still subject to change. However, these changes are expected to be very small, and there will always be a migration path provided, like with every other similar change so far.
- The documentation is still missing for some niche, rarely used features.
- There are no public samples for every feature of the framework yet.
- The project hasn't been widely publicized, and its repositories haven't been prepared for the general public yet.

Most importantly though, it has been in production for more than a year now, in several applications.

### Who's using RainbowCake?

<!-- margin-left:0 !important; -->

The development of RainbowCake started within [AutSoft](https://autsoft.hu/en), where the framework is being used to build greenfield Android/Kotlin projects (such as [Sender!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.posta.kepeslap)), and it also serves as the foundation for applications that are being refactored from Java to Kotlin (such as a certain HR application)[.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.nexon.nexonmobile) Both of these examples are running on RainbowCake in production.

There are also multiple non-public projects using RainbowCake, for example, the 150-screen, 100kloc app discussed [in this talk](https://zsmb.co/talks/#reviewing-kotlin).

### Where's the source code? How can I contribute? Where do I open issues?

Some of these things are still being worked out, but you can start participating in the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/rainbowcake)!
