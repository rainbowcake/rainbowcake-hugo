### Who's using RainbowCake?

<!-- margin-left:0 !important; -->

The development of RainbowCake started within [AutSoft](https://autsoft.hu/en), where the framework is being used to build greenfield Android/Kotlin projects (such as [Sender](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.posta.kepeslap)), and it also serves as the foundation for applications that are being refactored from Java to Kotlin (such as [NEXON-PORT+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hu.nexon.nexonmobile)). Both of these examples are running on RainbowCake in production.

### Where's the source code? How can I contribute? Where do I open issues?

External contributors will soonâ„¢ be able to participate in the project on GitHub.
